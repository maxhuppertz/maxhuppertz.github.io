***Firm reactions to extreme weather and implications for policy design*** [[Latest version][jmp]]\
Climate change and extreme weather events are a global problem, but especially affect poor countries, including firms in these countries. We know that weather shocks affect these firms through both a demand and supply channel. Depending on which channel dominates, short-run firm adjustments to the shocks differ, and understanding these adjustments can help in designing better policy to reduce the impact of climate change on poor countries. I combine firm-level World Bank data with high-resolution weather data to show that weather shocks are primarily supply shocks, affecting non-agricultural firms across sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia by reducing their productivity. I further show that firms react to these shocks by scaling back their expenditures on productive capability, hiring less machinery, less space and fewer non-production workers. These adjustments further reduce firm productivity. I develop a simple international trade model featuring hired productive capability that rationalizes my reduced form findings. Combining the model with machine learning estimates of the impact of climate change, I highlight the importance of productivity adjustments for policy design: Productivity responses make trade cost reductions 1.7 times more effective at countering welfare losses from climate change.

***Climate change increases bilateral trade cost*** [[Working paper][trade_network_changes]]\
It is well established that climate change affects economic production, but is has not been studied whether it directly affects trade networks, especially trade costs. The ability to ship and receive goods is governed by the same economic principles as all other acts of production, and it makes sense that climate change would affect it as well. I use international trade and weather data covering almost 200 years to show that climate change increases trade cost. Estimating a simple gravity framework, I find that rising temperatures at the origin or destination country increase bilateral trade cost. I use a standard trade model to quantify the welfare impact of increased trade cost, finding that reverting the impact of climate change on trade cost since the 1910s would increase welfare in the 2010s by 0.81 percent. Looking at the distribution of gains, almost all countries are harmed by trade cost increases due to climate change but poor countries especially so. My methodology can easily be embedded in studies of the impact of climate change using models of international trade.

***Information frictions, demand for quality, and welfare in the market for antimalarials*** (with Russell
Morton)\
A third of the 627,00 global malaria deaths in 2019 occurred in Nigeria. Only 25% of Nigerians, however, use Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs), recommended by the WHO and the Nigerian government, as their antimalarial of choice. We assess whether concerns about substandard ACTs reduce take-up of ACTs. To answer this question, we run an RCT that reduces quality uncertainty by informing households about the frequency of substandard ACTs at nearby vendors, measured via mystery shopping, and providing free quality testing at local stalls. We use a novel, cost-effective infrared scanner to assess quality without damaging pills. To quantify equilibrium take-up incorporating general equilibrium effects and to consider scenarios without quality uncertainty, we estimate a structural model of antimalarial demand and supply incorporating how quality uncertainty interacts with price and quality supplied. The correlation between consumers’ quality uncertainty and price sensitivity influences prices, magnifying or attenuating the effects of quality uncertainty on take-up. This exercise advances upon WHO estimates of welfare costs of substandard ACTs that hold prices and take-up constant. We also use the model to show how quality uncertainty impacts the costs and effectiveness of common policies to improve take-up of high-quality pharmaceuticals: quality certification and subsidies.

***Information frictions and firm behavior: Evidence from the African Continental Free Trade Area*** (with Yewande Olapade and Socrates Majune) [[Summary of pilot results][trade_info_frictions_pedl]]\
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) lowers tariffs, harmonizes standards and decreases red tape, aiming to increase intra-African trade. We find, however, that a substantial fraction of Kenyan firms is unaware of the agreement. This is true even among larger firms and firms already engaged in international trade. We ask whether increasing awareness of the agreement and giving firms actionable information on changes relevant to their sector can increase engagement in international trade, especially for firms that are already directly exporting or importing. We use a randomized intervention providing actionable information on AfCFTA and allowing firms to inquire about information relevant to their operations. We combine our survey results with Kenyan customs data to track firms’ international transactions following the intervention. We embed our RCT results in a model of international trade featuring misinformation about trade cost, estimating the welfare costs of the information friction we highlight, and the benefit of policies aimed at removing it.
