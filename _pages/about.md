I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research focuses on economic development. I work on the impact of climate change on firms, trade and households, as well as the effect of information frictions on supply chains and consumer welfare. Much of my work combines rigorous reduced form methods with structural estimation to better understand the implications for the economy as a whole.
