I am a Research Economist at the Bank of England. I study the impact of climate change on firms and trade. I have also worked on the effect of information frictions on supply chains. I use reduced-form and machine learning methods to identify causal relationships, and combine those with structural models to understand equilibrium and policy implications. I received my PhD from the University of Michigan in 2024.
