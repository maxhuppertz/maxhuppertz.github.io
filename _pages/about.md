I am a 2023/24 job market candidate in economics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

My research focuses on economic development. I work on the impact of climate change on firms and trade, as well as the effect of information frictions on supply chains and consumer welfare. I combine reduced form and machine learning methods with structural estimation to better understand implications for the economy as a whole.

**Fields**: Development Economics, Environmental Economics; Trade/Industrial Organization

I am a German citizen and considering positions globally, including in the US, Canada and Europe.
