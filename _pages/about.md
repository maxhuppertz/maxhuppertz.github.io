I am a Research Economist at the Bank of England. I study the impact of climate change. I use reduced-form methods to identify causal relationships, and combine those with structural models to understand their equilibrium and policy implications. I also have an interest in development economics, especially the effect of information frictions on supply chains. I received a PhD in Economics from the University of Michigan in 2024.
