My research focuses on economic development. I work on the impact of climate change on firms and trade, as well as the effect of information frictions on supply chains and consumer welfare. I use reduced-form and machine learning methods to identify causal relationships combined with structural models from trade and IO to understand equilibrium and policy implications.

**Fields**: Development Economics, Environmental Economics; Trade/Industrial Organization

I will be joining the [Bank of England][boe] as a Research Economist in the fall.
